The
<a href="https://veres.one/">Veres One</a> Blockchain is a permissionless
public ledger designed specifically for the creation and management of
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">decentralized identifiers</a>
(DIDs).
Veres One DIDs are self-administered identifiers that may be used by people,
organizations, and digital devices to establish an identifier that is
under their control. Veres One DIDs are useful in ecosystems where one needs
to issue, store, and use
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>. This
specification defines how a developer may create and update DIDs in the Veres
One Blockchain.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
The Veres One Project envisions a world where people and organizations
control their identifiers and their identity data. The Veres One
Blockchain is a fit-for-purpose blockchain optimized for identity on the
Web. The network ecosystem is designed to be self-sufficient through the
use of an innovative operational and funding model. The operational model
ensures openness, prevents attacks against the network, and financially
rewards individuals and organizations that choose to run software to
ensure the security of the network. Human dignity demands that every
individual be able to participate equally in our increasingly digital
society. That means everyone deserves the ability create and administer
unique, globally resolvable identifiers. For that reason, the network is
global and open to the public; anyone may participate.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p>
To date, every identifier you use online does not belong to you; it
belongs to someone else.
    </p>

    <p>
The Internet was not designed with interoperable identity systems in mind.
This inevitably forced websites to create their own solutions, which are
not interoperable.
    </p>

    <p>
When you sign up to a website, you typically create a username and a
password. The website asks you for this information so that it can start
to associate data with you. The more benevolent use of this data is to
customize an experience suited to your needs. This identifier and data,
however, are locked away on the site; they are not portable. Even the
global identifiers that websites use, such as your email address, are not
owned by you. The email address "you@bigcorp.com" isn’t owned by you, it’s
owned by BigCorp. You do not have control over your identifier nor your
data.
    </p>

    <p>
Since this data is not portable, you must rebuild your identity
information -- your identifiers and data -- from scratch on many different
websites. Duplicating that information often means sharing more than
intended, allowing websites to learn things and <em>infer</em> things about you
that you didn’t expect. It also means that each website accumulates toxic
data about you, inviting behavior like spam, financial fraud, data
siloing, data warehousing, and identity theft. Initiatives like the
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) only increase
the pressure to address these problems.
    </p>

    <p>
In addition to risks from the information we explicitly share with
websites, there is also a vast amount of identity information already out
there, with few mechanisms for managing it. This outside information is
often combined with the information we share to create surprisingly
detailed profiles, used for everything from ad targeting to site
customization to custom pricing (not always for lower prices). The result
is a strong economic incentive for large data warehousing companies to
store and sell your information, often without your consent.
    </p>

    <h2>The Vision</h2>

    <p>
The Veres One Blockchain's purpose is to enable all people and organizations
in the world to:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
create and own their online identifiers, and
      </li>
      <li>
control their identity data and with whom they share that data.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
Achieving this vision will enable a Web where:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
Our identity information and identifiers are owned and controlled by
each of us.
      </li>
      <li>
We can more strongly prove  key attributes about our digital personas,
reducing fraud.
      </li>
      <li>
Data can be bound to identifiers under our control instead of only to
websites, or stuck on paper in file cabinets, improving data portability.
      </li>
      <li>
Privacy can be enhanced by choosing when and with whom our information
is shared.
      </li>
      <li>
Data sharing can be more easily reduced to the minimum required for a
given interaction.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
This vision is shared among a large community of people working within
global organizations such as the Internet Identity Workshop, World Wide
Web Consortium, Internet Engineering Task Force, United Nations ID2020,
Decentralized Identity Foundation, and the Rebooting the Web of Trust
project. This DID Method specification is a realization of this vision.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>
The Veres One Blockchain is a fit-for-purpose blockchain built
specifically for Decentralized Identifiers. This specialization enables
the blockchain to be faster, more cost effective, and more privacy
enhancing compared to existing blockchains that are being repurposed for
identity management. The Veres One Blockchain was designed and built with
the following goals in mind:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
<strong><em>Public</em></strong> - Anyone in the world may read and audit the
entire contents of the ledger.
      </li>
      <li>
<strong><em>Permissionless</em></strong> - Any person or organization in the
world may create and control their identifiers.
      </li>
      <li>
<strong><em>Leaderless</em></strong> - Blockchain consensus relies on leaderless
elector collaboration, not proof of work, to determine when consensus has been
finalized. Electors are selected dynamically to allow participants to join
and leave the network and to ensure that there is no centralization or
single point of failure for the ledger.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><em>
Based entirely on open standards and open specifications
        </strong></em>
- Broad implementation and interoperability can only be achieved if all aspects
of the system are documented and standardized in a non-discriminatory,
patent-free and royalty-free manner while ensuring that the creators and
maintainers of the system are properly funded.
      </li>
      <li>
<strong><em>Built on a stakeholder driven governance model</em></strong> - The
source code and development team have a strict mission-driven focus that always
puts the users of the ledger first.
      </li>
      <li>
<strong><em>Economically sustainable</em></strong> - The people that create,
run, and protect the network are paid by the Veres One Project to do so.
Avoiding a "tragedy of the commons" is essential for sound network economics
for a global public utility.
      </li>
      <li>
<strong><em>Non-speculative</em></strong> - Unlike other ledgers, the Veres
One Blockchain does not need a speculative network token or cryptocurrency,
which eliminates currency speculation, thus ensuring predictable long term
operational costs.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Performance</h2>

    <p>
Based on the goals stated in the previous section, benchmarking has been
performed on the reference Veres One implementation that is able to achieve
the following performance characteristics.
    </p>

    <p class="issue"
      title="Warning: Benchmarks are not reflective of real world performance">
Benchmarking is a poor substitute for measurements taken over long periods of
time in hostile environments such as the public Internet. Attacks, routing
inefficiencies, packet drops, misconfigured software, and annoying physical
limitations such as the speed of light all contribute to degraded performance
in real world settings. This section should be taken with a large grain of salt
until we have dependable real world data.
    </p>

    <p class="issue"
      title="Warning: Benchmarks are highly dependent on node configuration">
The configuration for the benchmarks used 1 database with 7 electors
configured. The database was an AWS AWS i3.large instance consisting
of 2 vCPUs, 15.25GB RAM and Local NVME Storage. Each node was an AWS
c5.large instance with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM.
    </p>

    <p>
The Veres One Blockchain uses a leaderless, non-blocking,
byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm called Continuity.
The algorithm reaches consensus with probability 1 as long as there are at
least 2f+1 nodes in the system where <em>f</em> is the number of byzantine
failures. Since the algorithm is non-blocking and nodes can progress
at their own pace, the limiting factor is how quickly events can be gossiped
around the network. This approach results in very high throughputs.
Transactions are limited by two factors: 1) the fastest 2/3rds
of elector's database write speeds and 2) the time it takes to distribute
12f + 1 merge events to every elector in the network, the rate of which is
an exponential function.
    </p>

    <table class="simple">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Metric</th>
          <th>Capability</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
Throughput
          </td>
          <td>
~???K/sec (???M / day)
          </td>
          <td>
The throughput is a function of how quickly 12f+1 events can be transmitted to
each elector. Limiting factors include database write speed,
communication speed, and digital signature verification speed.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
Consensus Latency
          </td>
          <td>
~30 seconds
          </td>
          <td>
The latency is a function of how many electors there are in the system. How
many electors there are in the system is a function of the risk tolerance of
the network.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  <h1>Core Data Model</h1>

  <p>
The Veres One Data model is a graph-based data model that is semantically
rigorous. The syntax used for the data model is [[!JSON-LD]], which is based on
18+ years of Linked Data standardization work at the W3C. The ledger portions
of the data model build upon the [[!WEB-LEDGER]] specification. The digital
signatures and proofs data models build upon the, [[!LD-PROOFS]] and
[[!LD-SIGNATURES]] specifications. The Decentralized Identifiers portion of the
data model builds upon the [[!DID]] specification.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="diagrams/data-model.svg" style="max-width: 50%;"/>
    <figcaption>
The Veres One data model
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
The core data model is fairly simple and consists of a Ledger. The Ledger
contains Blocks. The Blocks contain Operations. The Operations contain
instructions that modify the state of the ledger. For example, there are
Operations to create a DID Document and update a DID Document.
  </p>

  <p>
The data model also consists of a state machine that is modified as
Operations execute. The state machine can be queried using Veres One DIDs,
which will return the current DID Document associated with the Veres One DID.
  </p>

</section>

<section>
  <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Veres One DID Format</h2>

    <p>
Veres One DIDs have the following format:
    </p>

    <p class="issue" title="ABNF needs to be more restrictive">
The ABNF below needs to be tightened up. For example, it should enforce
the UUID format if UUID-based Veres One DIDs are used.
    </p>

    <pre class="nohighlight">
      v1did        = "did:v1:" v1class ": " v1identifier  [ ";" did-service ]
                       [ "/" did-path ] [ "?" did-query ] [ "#" did-fragment ]
      v1class      = ( "nym" / "uuid" )
      v1identifier = %x41-5A / %x61-7A / %x5F / %2D
    </pre>

    <p>
There are two primary classes of DID-based identifiers in Veres One. The first
type of identifier is called a cryptonym-based identifier. This identifier
is a SHA-256 hash of a public key. Cryptonym-based identifiers are not required
to be registered on the ledger and may be used as unregistered pseudonymous
pairwise identifiers. These identifiers may also be registered on the
ledger and MUST contain a <code>authentication</code> key with a public key
fingerprint equal to the value of the cryptonym-based identifier.
    </p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A valid Veres One Cryptonym-based Decentralized Identifier">
      did:v1:nym:4jWHwNdrG9-6jd9I7K1si3kTRneNwftZV9m6rkrAfWQ
    </pre>

    <p>
The second type of identifier on Veres One is a UUID-based identifier and
may be used by entities that want to store metadata on the ledger. These sorts
of identifiers are often used, but not limited to, storing and refering to
Capabilities and Revocation lists.
    </p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A valid Veres One UUID-based Decentralized Identifier">
      did:v1:uuid:804c6ac3-ce3b-46ce-b134-17175d5bee74
    </pre>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Authentication</h2>

    <p>
Authentication is the process the ledger uses to determine if an entity
is associated with a DID.
    </p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Expressing authentication credentials">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/veres-one/v1",

  <span class="highlight">"authentication": [... array of acceptable authentication suites ...]</span>
}
    </pre>

  <section>
    <h2>Authorization</h2>

    <p>
The Veres One Ledger uses
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-ocap/">Linked Data Object
Capabilities</a> to authorize operations to be performed on DID Documents.
    </p>

    <p>
Granting a capability is equivalent to giving someone your car keys. Your
car doesn't know who the person is with the key, it just knows that when the
key is turned in the ignition, the car should start.
The benefit of object capabilities is that, unlike a car key, you can set
arbitrary restrictions on the usage of a capability. For example, setting
an expiration time for the capability, or a geofenced zone in which it can
be used.
    </p>

    <p>
The Veres One data model supports two types of capability suites, one for
granting capabilities and the other for invoking capabilities.
    </p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="">{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/veres-one/v1",
  "id": "did:v1:nym:4jWHwNdrG9-6jd9I7K1si3kTRneNwftZV9m6rkrAfWQ",

  <span class="highlight">"invokeCapability": [... array of capability invocation suites ...]</span>

    <h2>HTTP API Discovery</h2>

    <p>
A website may provide HTTP API endpoint discovery by embedding JSON-LD in their
top-most HTML web page (e.g. at <code>https://example.com/</code>):
    </p>

    <pre class="example highlight" title="Example of HTML-based service description">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8">

  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;!-- page content -->
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
    </pre>

    <p>
Service descriptions may also be requested via content negotiation.
In the following example a JSON-compatible service description is provided
(e.g. <code>curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://example.com/</code>):

    <h2>Creating a DID</h2>

    <p>
A DID is created by performing an HTTP POST of a signed operation
to the <code>veresOneOperationsService</code>. The following HTTP status codes
are defined for this service:
    </p>

    <table class="simple">
      <thead>
        <th style="white-space: nowrap">HTTP Status</th>

        <tr>
          <td>202</td>
          <td>
DID creation request was accepted. The HTTP <code>Location</code> header will
contain the URL for the newly created ledger operation. The operation is not
guaranteed to succeed. You can check to see if the operation succeeded by
requesting the operation, which will eventually refer to an event and a block
if it was successful.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>400</td>
          <td>Operation failed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>409</td>
