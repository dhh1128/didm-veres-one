The Veres One Ledger is a permissionless public ledger designed specifically
for the creation and management of
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">decentralized identifiers</a>
(DIDs).
Veres One DIDs are
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/path-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign
identifiers</a> that may be used by people, organizations, and digital devices
to establish their identity. Veres One DIDs are useful in ecosystems where one
needs to issue, store, and use
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Claims</a>. This
specification defines how a developer may create and update DIDs in the Veres
One Ledger.
